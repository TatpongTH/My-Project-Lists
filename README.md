# My-Project-Lists
This is the list of my projects:

- Microprocessor projects are about coding programs by using Assembly Language and C Language.
  There are 3 projects:
    - The first one is mainly about coding by using Assembly Language to control the LEDs then transfer all the coding into an STM32 board.
    - The second one is about controling 7 segments by using GPIO commands and C Language.
    - The third one is about Serial Communication and making a chatbot where the data will be transfered into the STM32 board and the board should be able to communicate with us.

- Sonnet Lite (ZIP file) is about designing Butterworth filters or Chebyshev filter for transmission line. 

  In this project, we choose Butterworth to design our filter (THIS IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS!!!)

- Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Project: This project is about seperating Music from Vocal by using Fast Fourier Transform. (The result does not met with my expectation)
